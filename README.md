# Free Code Camp Markdown Previewer
Free Code Camp Front Libraries Project. Just type your text in the editor and will appear in the previewer. Made with HTML, CSS, React, Marked.js and Bootstrap.

## Contributing
This repository is based on starter code from the create-react-app and Ben Brooke's Markdown Previewer tutorial. Therefore I will not be accepting any pull requests.
